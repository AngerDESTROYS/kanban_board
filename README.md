# GitHub Repository Kanban Board
## Introduction
This repository contains a simple React application for managing GitHub issues using a Kanban board. The application allows you to input a GitHub repository URL, fetch its issues, and organize them into three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done. I used react-beautiful-dnd for implementing drag and drop functionality and also utilized Redux to dispatch actions whenever there are changes to the arrays holding the issues. Additionally, I created several tests with ts-jest to ensure proper rendering with different data and to verify the storage of repository data after entering the repository link.

For styling, I incorporated some Bootstrap components and classes, as well as inline styles using style objects.
